# What is Orbs?

Orbs is an open, decentralized and public blockchain infrastructure executed by a secure network of permissionless validators using Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus.

## Decentralized Network

* **Dozens of permissionless validators**\
  Anyone can participate in the Orbs consensus protocol, similar to Ethereum and Bitcoin. Dozens of independent validators have been running on the production Orbs mainnet since early 2019. Elected validators in the protocol are called _Guardians_.\

* **Proof-of-Stake consensus implemented as EVM smart contracts**\
  A committee of honest validator nodes (Guardians) is elected using PoS. Every validator stakes ORBS tokens in smart contracts running on Ethereum and Polygon. Guardians can also receive delegated stake from Orbs community participants. Over $100,000,000 of value is actively staked in Orbs PoS contracts.\

* **Strong security guarantees backed by Ethereum itself**\
  The Orbs PoS algorithm is implemented as EVM smart contracts running on the Ethereum mainnet. This unique model guarantees the sanctity of Orbs' elections using Ethereum's own security guarantees. Orbs is the first PoS network that does not calculate its own elections and is [objectively auditable](https://www.orbs.com/pos-external-oversight/) from outside.

## Layer 3 Protocol

Orbs is an L3 protocol and runs over existing L1/L2 blockchains. Orbs caters to apps running on existing L1s like Ethereum and TON and allows them to enhance the capabilities of their existing smart contracts.

Orbs does not compete with L1s like Ethereum and TON - it runs on top of them.

## Bringing CeFi-level execution to DeFi

As a decentralized Layer-3 (L3) blockchain infrastructure, Orbs is optimized specifically for advanced on-chain trading. Orbs improves on-chain trading by providing technology for aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and decentralized derivatives.

This is made possible by Orbs enhancing the capabilities of both EVM and non-EVM smart contracts without moving liquidity onto a new chain. This unique setup creates a decentralized backend that brings CeFi-level execution to DeFi trading.
