# orbs-v3 overview

> Orbs v3 bring two main features to its decentralised network
## orbs-vm
orbs-vm is a robust and simple way to deploy a docker container to orbs decentralized nodes, that can add a layer3 functionality to L2 and L1 networks, such as ETH and Polygon,BNB etc.

Instead of writing a complicated and very limited, network specific *smart contract*, you can now develop a full application running in a docker container yet in a decentralized manner, with full interaction with any of the layer 1 and layer 2 networks

## orbs-lambda

orbs-lambda is similat to aws lambdam where you can install simple JS code to interact with L1+L2 contracts which can be trigger upon different type of events.

Some events could fire upon L1+L2 events, Time based crontab like events or others.
