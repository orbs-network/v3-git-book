# Notification Protocol

## What is the Notifications Protocol?

The Open DeFi Notification Protocol is a community led initiative to provide users with decentralized and free mobile notifications for on-chain events related to their DeFi holdings.

### Goals

1. Always free for users - no subscription fees or ads\
   We believe that mobile alerts for DeFi positions should be a free core blockchain service accessible to anyone, much like MetaMask or Etherscan.
2. Never miss anything - mobile app with persistent alarms and even phone calls\
   When money is involved and you're about to be liquidated, you can't afford to miss a notification. We will wake you up if needed in the middle of the night.
3. Multi network support - Ethereum, BSC, Polygon and more\
   The DeFi ecosystem is constantly expanding to new networks like Polygon and Arbitrum. The protocol is chain agnostic and designed to integrate with any ecosystem.
4. Community-led open protocol with public and decentralized alert nodes\
   Core blockchain services should be as decentralized as possible. Allow any developer to contribute code, any project to integrate and any validator to help run nodes.
