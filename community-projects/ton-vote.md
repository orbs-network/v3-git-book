### Verified Voting Results Using Orbs L3

TON.vote implements Orbsâ€™ L3 technology, with the Orbs independent pool of Guardians (validators) providing an extra layer of assurance to the already robust voting system. In addition to independent validators and manual chain checking, Orbs Guardians independently verify the accuracy of the displayed votes in the UI with those stored in the smart contract data.

This extra level of verification ensures that there is no tampering with the votes, as they are stored in an immutable format. By cross-checking the information presented on the front end, the Orbs Guardians verify that there is no mismatch of data, reinforcing the entire process's trust and transparency.
