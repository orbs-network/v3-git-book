# Getting Started

Orbs Lambda provides an interface for you to create your automation tasks.

Before getting started you should:

* [Check if we support the network your smart contract is running on](supported-networks.md)
* Set up your environment with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version?)

Full working examples can be found at the [Orbs Lambda repository](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-lambda/tree/master/examples)

## Environment

Tasks are executed in a node (version) runtime environment.

You may import any of the following packages, which are pre-installed in the environment:

```
web3
bignumber.js
dotenv
ethereum-multicall
node-fetch
axios
```

If you wish to use a package not included in this list, please contact us.
