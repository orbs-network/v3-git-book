# Introduction

###Orbs Lambda - Decentralized Serverless Cloud Function

Orbs Lambda is an event driven, serverless and decentralized computing solution, similar in concept to AWS Lambda - only decentralized.

Write your cloud function in the industry standard language JavaScript, without any blockchain specific knowledge. Your code can utilize dozens of familiar libraries such as node-fetch. Select a trigger for execution, such as a scheduled time interval, a new block or a new on-chain event, and deploy. The whole process can take as little as 30 minutes.

Orbs Lambda is not meant to replace your smart contracts. It is a complementary solution that allows developers to enrich their business logic without sacrificing decentralization.

For a more flexible solution resembling AWS EC2 see Orbs VM.
