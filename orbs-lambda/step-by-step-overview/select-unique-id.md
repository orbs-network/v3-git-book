# Select Unique ID

Every Orbs Lambda function has a unique ID that identifies it. You are free to choose any meaningful unique ID that is currently free. Your unique ID will be registered when your lambda is deployed for the first time.

## Allowed characters

Lowercase alpha-numeric characters and dashes.

The running example in these docs will be: `unique-example`

## Check for collisions

Your can make sure your unique ID is free by looking at the official [Orbs Lambda repo](https://github.com/orbs-network/orbs-lambda) on GitHub.
