The Orbs Network includes dozens of independent validators that run Proof-of-Stake consensus and execute Orbs VM Docker containers in a decentralized manner.

Orbs is not an L1 blockchain and is not trying to replace existing smart contracts. It is more accurately described as an _oracle network_ similar to [Chainlink](https://chain.link/), operating in L3. Orbs runs over leading L1/L2 blockchains like the EVM and TON and allows dapps to enhance smart contracts with advanced capabilities that are [unsupported](../overview/enhanced-execution.md) by the sandboxed L1/L2 smart contract model.
