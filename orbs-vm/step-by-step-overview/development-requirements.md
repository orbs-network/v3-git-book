# Development Requirements

## Install Docker

Docker is an execution engine that runs containers as mini virtual machines. Installing it locally will allow you to test your container on your machine before deployment.

Instructions: [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

## Install Git

Git is the source control manager used by the popular open source hub GitHub. Install it locally to allow you to maintain versions of your code and push them to Orbs.

Instructions: [https://github.com/git-guides/install-git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)

## Docker registry account

Once your docker image is ready, it needs to be published to a publicly readable [docker registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/). We recommend that you open a free account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/) for this purpose but you may select other [alternatives](https://www.aquasec.com/cloud-native-academy/docker-container/docker-registry/).

Instructions: [https://hub.docker.com/signup](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

## GitHub account

As part of the deployment process, you will need to open a PR (pull request) to Orbs open source GitHub repo. This will normally require you to have a free GitHub account.
