# Select Unique ID

Every Orbs VM service has a unique ID that identifies it. You are free to choose any meaningful unique ID that is currently free. Your unique ID will be registered when your service is deployed for the first time.

## Allowed characters

Lowercase alpha-numeric characters and dashes. The ID must start with `vm-` prefix.

The running example in these docs will be: `vm-unique-example`

## Check for collisions

Your can make sure your unique ID is free by looking at the official [Orbs VM repo ](https://github.com/orbs-network/mainnet-deployment/blob/main/mainnet.json)on GitHub.
