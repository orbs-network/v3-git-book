# L3 for Advanced Trading

Orbsâ€™ aim is to revolutionize on-chain trading by delivering CeFi-level pricing and execution capabilities to the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

This is achieved by leveraging Orbs innovative Layer-3 blockchain infrastructure, which enhances existing Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions and enables complex logic to be implemented on a fully decentralized stack without moving liquidity to a new chain. Utilizing proof-of-stake consensus, Orbs acts as a decentralized backend that powers unique protocols such as dLIMIT, dTWAP, Liquidity Hub, and Perpetual Hub. These, in turn, optimize trading with aggregated liquidity, advanced trading orders, and on-chain derivatives, which push the boundaries of DeFi and on-chain trading.

### Services or Products

Orbs provides a robust Layer-3 blockchain infrastructure designed specifically to bring advanced CeFi-level execution to on-chain trading.\
\
This infrastructure powers four main protocols, which can be integrated into existing DeFi applications:

1. **dTWAP Protocol** - advanced order type for DEXs allowing for CeFi-level TWAP orders to be executed on- chain.
2. **dLIMIT Protocol** - advanced order type for DEXs allowing for CeFi-level limit orders to be executed on -chain. &#x20;
3. **Liquidity Hub** - decentralized optimization layer for DEXs enabling DEXs to tap into external liquidity sources in order to provide CeFi-competitive prices on swaps.&#x20;
4. **Perpetual Hub** - full suite of services, including hedger, liquidator and oracle, enabling intent-based on-chain perpetual futures trading.   &#x20;

### How do Users Benefit from Protocols Powered by Orbs:

Users benefit from the integration of protocols powered by Orbs in several key ways:

* **On-chain Access to Advanced Trading Products and Services** - Orbs enables DEXs to provide, on-chain, sophisticated trading features found in CeFi Venues. Protocols such as dLIMIT and dTWAP offer advanced order types like TWAP and limit orders directly on decentralized exchanges, which were previously unavailable on-chain. This advancement allows traders to execute more strategic and controlled trades, enhancing their trading experience and capabilities.
* **Competitive Pricing and Lower Fees** - For DEXs utilizing Liquidity Hub, Orbs provides their users with access to aggregated liquidity from multiple sources, ensuring more competitive pricing on swaps. This means users can achieve better prices and lower fees compared to traditional decentralized exchanges that may suffer from liquidity fragmentation. Additionally, for decentralized perpetuals platforms, integrating Perpetual Hub offers users more capital-efficient perpetual trading, translating to better pricing and reduced costs for users engaging in perpetual futures trading.
* **Decentralization and Privacy** - Protocols powered by Orbs maintain the core principles of decentralization, providing users with enhanced privacy, security, and anonymity. By eliminating the need for centralized backends, Orbs ensures that users can trade in a decentralized manner, protecting their data and maintaining control over their assets.
