The Orbs Network includes dozens of independent validators that run Proof-of-Stake consensus and execute the Orbs protocol in a decentralized manner.

Orbs is not an L1 blockchain, it is more accurately described as an oracle network similar to[ Chainlink](https://chain.link/), operating in L3. Orbs runs over leading L1/L2 blockchains like the EVM and TON. Orbs PoS is implemented with L1 smart contracts running on these blockchains.
